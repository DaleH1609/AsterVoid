Brief description of the game developed: 
The game involves a rocket ship having to avoid asteroids while collecting satellites. 
There is a red boundary at the top of the window to give the game added difficulty. This also makes it harder to judge where the asteroids are going to hit.
Once the ship has been hit 5 times the game will end, I added a feature that makes the ship smaller when it gets it. I done this to give the player a better indication of the amount of lives they have.
I added a bonus satellite which disappears when it hits the bottom of the window. This satellite is worth 2 points.

Known bugs/problems: 
The keylogger can sometimes bug out. If I hit an arrow key it causes the ship to continuously go in a direction even if I only hit it once.
The collision detection can often detect a hit when it doesn't collide with the ship.
